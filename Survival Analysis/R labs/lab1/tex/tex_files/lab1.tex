Consider the following data from the Ohio State University Bone Marrow Transplant Unit
on the time to death or relapse (in months) after bone marrow transplant for 12 patients
with non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. For the purposes of this exercise, assume that there are no
censored event times.
\begin{align}
1,\ 2,\ 2,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8,\ 16,\ 17,\ 34. \nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 \item Using the above data, calculate the empirical estimate of the survival function,
 $\hat{S}(t^{+})$, by hand. Summarize your calculations in a table containing the survival times, the number of deaths at each time point, and $\hat{S}(t^{+})$. Use your own \verb!R! code to verify your calculations.
 \item Use the \verb|survfit| function to verify your results.
 \item Use the \verb|plot| function to produce a graph of the estimated survival function.
 \item Show how the estimated standard error is calculated for $t=6^{+}$.
 \item Identify the estimated median survival. 
\end{enumerate}
